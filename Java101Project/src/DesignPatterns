here are some common design patterns
polymorphism -> school system
composition -> car
factory (singleton) -> encapsulates object creation (1 standard way of managing the creation of objects
mvc -> standard tbh
builder -> string builder (start simple and build a complex object sequentially, returning with toString())
chain of command -> logging (error gets passed, handled, or exited along chain of command)
